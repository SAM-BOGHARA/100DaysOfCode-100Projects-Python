<p>Today we're going to analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. Let's see what patterns we can uncover
    in the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally.</p>

<p>On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused
    a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. Alfred Nobel dictates
    that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have
    conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”. Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the
    categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.</p>

<p><strong>Using Google Colab?&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Upgrade plotly </strong></p>
<p>Google Colab comes with a lot of Python packages pre-installed and working. However, you can also install new
    packages as well as upgrade existing packages. In our case, the plotly package is outdated and will cause a problem
    with our starburst chart. Here's how to updated a package in Google Colab:</p>

<h4>Challenge 1</h4>
<p>Preliminary data exploration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>What is the shape of <code>df_data</code>? How many rows and columns?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What are the column names and what kind of data is inside of them?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In which year was the Nobel prize first awarded?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which year is the latest year included in the dataset?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenge 2</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Are there any duplicate values in the dataset?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Are there NaN values in the dataset?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which columns tend to have NaN values?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How many NaN values are there per column?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Why do these columns have NaN values?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenge 3</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Convert the <code>birth_date</code> column to Pandas <code>Datetime</code> objects</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add a Column called <code>share_pct</code> which has the laureates' share as a percentage in the form of a
            floating-point number.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 1:&nbsp;Preliminary Data Exploration</strong></p>
<p>When we run <code>df_data.shape</code>, <code>df_data.tail()</code>, and <code>df_data.head()</code>, we see that
    there are 962 rows and 16 columns. The first Nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 and the data goes up to 2020. </p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_11-00-28-1798f7e1537c4a5e3a5197eb6411a12b.png">
</figure>
<p>We notice that the columns contain the following information: </p>
<p><strong>birth_date</strong>: date in string format</p>
<p><strong>motivation</strong>:&nbsp;description of what the prize is for</p>
<p><strong>prize_share</strong>:&nbsp;given as a fraction</p>
<p><strong>laureate_type:&nbsp;</strong>individual or organisation</p>
<p><strong>birth_country</strong>:&nbsp;has countries that no longer exist</p>
<p><strong>birth_country_current</strong>:&nbsp;current name of the country where the birth city is located</p>
<p><strong>ISO: </strong>three-letter international country code</p>
<p><strong>organization_name</strong>: research institution where the discovery was made</p>
<p><strong>organization_city:&nbsp;</strong>location of the institution</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:&nbsp;NaN&nbsp;values</strong></p>
<p>There are no duplicates in the dataset:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(f'Any duplicates? {df_data.duplicated().values.any()}')</pre>
<p>However, there are a number of NaN&nbsp;values</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(f'Any NaN values among the data? {df_data.isna().values.any()}')</pre>
<p>We can get a count of the NaN&nbsp;values per column using </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data.isna().sum()</pre>
<figure><img height="310"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_11-10-39-9f5107ed7f79742d98c60af382a4a4e7.png"
        width="518"></figure>
<p>Why are there so many NaN&nbsp;values for the birth date?&nbsp;And why are there so many missing values among the
    organisation columns?</p>
<p>Filtering on the NaN&nbsp;values in the birth date column we see that we get back a bunch of organisations, like the
    UN or the Red Cross. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">col_subset = ['year','category', 'laureate_type',
              'birth_date','full_name', 'organization_name']
df_data.loc[df_data.birth_date.isna()][col_subset]</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_11-24-58-ca4ff85fc797f3662c8ed33c9ac7b481.png">
</figure>
<p>That makes sense. We also see that since the organisation's name is in the full_name column, the organisation_name
    column contains NaN. </p>
<p>In addition, when we look at for rows where the organization_name column has no value, we also see that many prizes
    went to people who were not affiliated with a university or research institute. This includes many of the Literature
    and Peace prize winners.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">col_subset = ['year','category', 'laureate_type','full_name', 'organization_name']
df_data.loc[df_data.organization_name.isna()][col_subset]</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_11-26-52-390f5c9ddbfce24588ff4f6a59ad1028.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;Type Conversions</strong></p>
<p>We can use pandas to convert the birth_date to a Datetime object with a single line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data.birth_date = pd.to_datetime(df_data.birth_date)</pre>
<p>Adding a column that contains the percentage share as first requires that we split the string on the forward slash.
    Then we can convert to a number. And finally, we can do the division.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">separated_values = df_data.prize_share.str.split('/', expand=True)
numerator = pd.to_numeric(separated_values[0])
denomenator = pd.to_numeric(separated_values[1])
df_data['share_pct'] = numerator / denomenator</pre>
<p>Now we can check if our type conversions were successful:</p>

<h1>3</h1>
<h4>Challenge 1:&nbsp;Come up with 3 Questions</h4>
<p>A big part of data science is coming up with questions that you'd like to explore. This is the most difficult aspect
    to teach in a tutorial because it's completely open-ended and requires some creativity. Often times you will be
    asking questions of the data, that it actually cannot answer - and that's ok. That's all part of the process of
    discovery. </p>
<p>Pause here for a moment and think about the kind of data you saw in the columns. Write down at least 3 questions that
    you'd like to explore as part of this analysis. For example, your question might go like: "What percentage of the
    Nobel laureates were women?" or "How many prizes were given out in each category". <strong>Practice coming up with a
        few of your own questions</strong>. </p>
<p>In the upcoming lessons, you might find that we will write the code to answer some of your questions. And if not,
    your questions make for a great exercise to take this analysis even further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The challenges below are all based on questions we're going to ask the data:</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 2</h4>
<p>Create a <a href="https://plotly.com/python/pie-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donut chart using
        plotly</a> which shows how many prizes went to men compared to how many prizes went to women. What percentage of
    all the prizes went to women?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 3</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>What are the names of the first 3 female Nobel laureates?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What did the win the prize for?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What do you see in their <code>birth_country</code>? Were they part of an organisation?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 4</h4>
<p>Did some people get a Nobel Prize more than once? If so, who were they?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 5</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>In how many categories are prizes awarded?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a plotly bar chart with the number of prizes awarded by category.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Use the color scale called <code>Aggrnyl</code> to colour the chart, but don't show a color axis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which category has the most number of prizes awarded?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which category has the fewest number of prizes awarded?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 6</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>When was the first prize in the field of Economics awarded?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Who did the prize go to?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 7</h4>
<p>Create a <a href="https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plotly bar
        chart</a> that shows the split between men and women by category.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Hover over the bar chart. How many prizes went to women in Literature compared to Physics?</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:&nbsp;Creating a Donut Chart with Plotly</strong></p>
<p>To create the chart we use the our <code>.value_counts()</code>&nbsp;method together with plotly's
    <code>.pie()</code> function. We see that out of all the Nobel laureates since 1901, only about 6.2% were women.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">biology = df_data.sex.value_counts()
fig = px.pie(labels=biology.index, 
             values=biology.values,
             title="Percentage of Male vs. Female Winners",
             names=biology.index,
             hole=0.4,)

fig.update_traces(textposition='inside', textfont_size=15, textinfo='percent')

fig.show()</pre>

</figure>
<p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;The first 3 women to win</strong></p>
<p>Even without looking at the data, you might have already guessed one of the famous names:&nbsp;Marie Curie. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data[df_data.sex == 'Female'].sort_values('year', ascending=True)[:3]</pre>
<p> <strong> </strong></p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_11-59-16-2880c50d998356973cfa975e30bd642c.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;The Repeat Winners</strong></p>
<p>Winning a Nobel prize is quite an achievement. However, some folks have actually won the prize multiple times. To
    find them, we can use many different approaches. One approach is to look for duplicates in the full_name column:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">is_winner = df_data.duplicated(subset=['full_name'], keep=False)
multiple_winners = df_data[is_winner]
print(f'There are {multiple_winners.full_name.nunique()}' \
      ' winners who were awarded the prize more than once.')</pre>
<p>There are 6 winners who were awarded the prize more than once.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">col_subset = ['year', 'category', 'laureate_type', 'full_name']
multiple_winners[col_subset]</pre>
<p>Only 4 of the repeat laureates were individuals.</p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_12-04-43-b5e52b86991f0ee6b5fd0c49ee6e0d3d.png">
</figure>
<p>We see that Marie Curie actually got the Nobel prize twice - once in physics and once in chemistry. Linus Carl
    Pauling got it first in chemistry and later for peace given his work in promoting nuclear disarmament. Also, the
    International Red Cross was awarded the Peace prize a total of 3 times. The first two times were both during the
    devastating World Wars. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 5: Number of Prizes per Category</strong></p>
<p>To find the number of unique categories in a column we can use:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data.category.nunique()</pre>
<p>To generate the vertical plotly bar chart, we again use <code>.value_counts()</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">prizes_per_category = df_data.category.value_counts()
v_bar = px.bar(
        x = prizes_per_category.index,
        y = prizes_per_category.values,
        color = prizes_per_category.values,
        color_continuous_scale='Aggrnyl',
        title='Number of Prizes Awarded per Category')

v_bar.update_layout(xaxis_title='Nobel Prize Category', 
                    coloraxis_showscale=False,
                    yaxis_title='Number of Prizes')
v_bar.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_13-59-47-6fea83b45bae6cda8e421d02b71aa380.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 6:&nbsp;The Economics Prize</strong></p>
<p>The chart above begs the question:&nbsp;"Why are there so few prizes in the field of economics?". Looking at the
    first couple of winners in the economics category, we have our answer:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data[df_data.category == 'Economics'].sort_values('year')[:3]</pre>
<p>The economics prize is much newer. It was first awarded in 1969, compared to 1901 for physics. </p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_14-03-25-9b4e50252c31bbc38d8171905a26b9a5.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 7: Male and Female Winners by Category</strong></p>
<p>We already saw that overall, only 6.2% of Nobel prize winners were female. Does this vary by category?</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">cat_men_women = df_data.groupby(['category', 'sex'], 
                               as_index=False).agg({'prize': pd.Series.count})
cat_men_women.sort_values('prize', ascending=False, inplace=True)</pre>
<p>We can combine <code>.groupby()</code> and <code>.agg()</code> with the <code>.count()</code> function. This way we
    can count the number of men and women by prize category. </p>
<figure><img height="462"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_14-06-59-34c0d756c22989eb982fcf00dd78bcff.png"
        width="274"></figure>
<p>We can then use <code>.color</code> the parameter in the <code>.bar()</code> function to mark the number of men and
    women on the chart:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">v_bar_split = px.bar(x = cat_men_women.category,
                     y = cat_men_women.prize,
                     color = cat_men_women.sex,
                     title='Number of Prizes Awarded per Category split by Men and Women')

v_bar_split.update_layout(xaxis_title='Nobel Prize Category', 
                          yaxis_title='Number of Prizes')
v_bar_split.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_14-09-23-ba9b59621175ffd123d135b4cd46fed5.png">
</figure>
<p>We see that overall the imbalance is pretty large with physics, economics, and chemistry. Women are somewhat more
    represented in categories of Medicine, Literature and Peace. Splitting bar charts like this is an incredibly
    powerful way to show a more granular picture. </p>

<p><strong>Solution 1:&nbsp;Number of Prizes Awarded over Time</strong></p>
<p>First, we have to count the number of Nobel prizes that are awarded each year. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">prize_per_year = df_data.groupby(by='year').count().prize </pre>
<p>This just involves grouping the data so that we can count the number of entries per year. To calculate the 5-year
    moving average we use <code>.rolling()</code> and <code>.mean()</code> like we did with the Google Trend data. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">moving_average = prize_per_year.rolling(window=5).mean()</pre>
<p> Now we can create a Matplotlib chart that superimposes the two:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.scatter(x=prize_per_year.index, 
           y=prize_per_year.values, 
           c='dodgerblue',
           alpha=0.7,
           s=100,)

plt.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        moving_average.values, 
        c='crimson', 
        linewidth=3,)

plt.show()</pre>

</figure>
<p>With the help of a little styling, this chart could look better. To create 5-year tick marks on the x-axis, we
    generate an array using NumPy:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">np.arange(1900, 2021, step=5)</pre>
<p>Then we tap into functions like the <code>.figure()</code>, the <code>.title()</code>, the <code>.xticks()</code>,
    and <code>.yticks()</code> to fine-tune the chart. </p>
<p>In addition, we will shortly be adding a second y-axis, so we can use an <code>Axes</code> object to draw our scatter
    and line plots. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(16,8), dpi=200)
plt.title('Number of Nobel Prizes Awarded per Year', fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(ticks=np.arange(1900, 2021, step=5), 
           fontsize=14, 
           rotation=45)

ax = plt.gca() # get current axis
ax.set_xlim(1900, 2020)

ax.scatter(x=prize_per_year.index, 
           y=prize_per_year.values, 
           c='dodgerblue',
           alpha=0.7,
           s=100,)

ax.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        moving_average.values,

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:&nbsp;The Prize Share of Laureates over Time</strong></p>
<p>Now we can work out the rolling average of the percentage share of the prize. If more prizes are given out, perhaps
    it is because the prize is split between more people. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">yearly_avg_share = df_data.groupby(by='year').agg({'share_pct': pd.Series.mean})
share_moving_average = yearly_avg_share.rolling(window=5).mean()</pre>
<p>If more people get the prize, then the average share should go down, right?&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(16,8), dpi=200)
plt.title('Number of Nobel Prizes Awarded per Year', fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(ticks=np.arange(1900, 2021, step=5), 
           fontsize=14, 
           rotation=45)

ax1 = plt.gca()
ax2 = ax1.twinx() # create second y-axis
ax1.set_xlim(1900, 2020)

ax1.scatter(x=prize_per_year.index, 
           y=prize_per_year.values, 
           c='dodgerblue',
           alpha=0.7,
           s=100,)

ax1.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        moving_average.values, 
        c='crimson', 
        linewidth=3,)

# Adding prize share plot on second axis
ax2.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        share_moving_average.values, 
        c='grey', 
        linewidth=3,)

plt.show()</pre>

</figure>
<p>To see the relationship between the number of prizes and the laureate share even more clearly we can invert the
    second y-axis. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(16,8), dpi=200)
plt.title('Number of Nobel Prizes Awarded per Year', fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(ticks=np.arange(1900, 2021, step=5), 
           fontsize=14, 
           rotation=45)

ax1 = plt.gca()
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax1.set_xlim(1900, 2020)

# Can invert axis
ax2.invert_yaxis()

ax1.scatter(x=prize_per_year.index, 
           y=prize_per_year.values, 
           c='dodgerblue',
           alpha=0.7,
           s=100,)

ax1.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        moving_average.values, 
        c='crimson', 
        linewidth=3,)

ax2.plot(prize_per_year.index, 
        share_moving_average.values, 
        c='grey', 
        linewidth=3,)

plt.show()</pre>
<p>What do we see on the chart?&nbsp;Well, there is clearly an upward trend in the number of prizes being given out as
    more and more prizes are shared. Also, more prizes are being awarded from 1969 onwards because of the addition of
    the economics category. We also see that very few prizes were awarded during the first and second world wars. Note
    that instead of there being a zero entry for those years, we instead see the effect of the wards as missing blue
    dots. </p>

<p>For this next bit, we're going to compare which countries actually get the most prizes. And we're also going to look
    at in which categories those prizes are awarded. This has me feeling a little like I'm at the Olympics 😊. </p>

<p>The hard part is preparing the data for this chart!</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: Take a two-step approach. The first step is grouping the data by country and category. Then you can
    create a DataFrame that looks something like this:</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 1:&nbsp;Prize ranking by Country</strong></p>
<p>Looking at our DataFrame there are actually 3 different columns to choose from for creating this
    ranking:&nbsp;<code>birth_country</code>, <code>birth_country_current</code> or <code>organization_country</code>.
    However, they each have certain problems and limitations. </p>
<p>If you look at the entries in the birth country, you'll see that some countries no longer exist! These include the
    Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia for example. Hence, using <code>birth_country_current</code> is better, since it has
    the country name which controls the city where the laureate was born. Now, notice that this does not determine the
    laureates' nationality since some globetrotting folks gave birth to their future Nobel laureate children while
    abroad. Also, people's nationalities can change as they emigrate and acquire different citizenship or get married
    and change citizenship. What this boils down to is that we will have to be clear about the assumptions that we will
    make in the upcoming analysis. </p>
<p>We can create the list of the top 20 countries like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">top_countries = df_data.groupby(['birth_country_current'], 
                                  as_index=False).agg({'prize': pd.Series.count})

top_countries.sort_values(by='prize', inplace=True)
top20_countries = top_countries[-20:]</pre>
<p>Note that the ranking here determines how our bar chart will be displayed. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">h_bar = px.bar(x=top20_countries.prize,
               y=top20_countries.birth_country_current,
               orientation='h',
               color=top20_countries.prize,
               color_continuous_scale='Viridis',
               title='Top 20 Countries by Number of Prizes')

h_bar.update_layout(xaxis_title='Number of Prizes', 
                    yaxis_title='Country',
                    coloraxis_showscale=False)
h_bar.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-28-14-d0951596c2e1a822e6b53fd9fc21e3ff.png">
</figure>
<p>The United States has a massive number of prizes by this measure. The UK&nbsp;and Germany are in second and third
    place respectively. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:&nbsp;Displaying the Data on a Map</strong></p>
<p>To show the above ranking on a colour coded map, we need to make use of the ISO&nbsp;codes. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_countries = df_data.groupby(['birth_country_current', 'ISO'], 
                               as_index=False).agg({'prize': pd.Series.count})
df_countries.sort_values('prize', ascending=False)</pre>
<p>This means we can use the ISO&nbsp;country codes for the <code>locations</code> parameter on the choropleth. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">world_map = px.choropleth(df_countries,
                          locations='ISO',
                          color='prize', 
                          hover_name='birth_country_current', 
                          color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.matter)

world_map.update_layout(coloraxis_showscale=True,)

world_map.show()</pre>
<p>I&nbsp;love it how plotly allows you to zoom in and pan on the map it generates.</p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-37-05-1293d524e40e6b3bd08f6f171ab4facb.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;The category breakdown by country</strong></p>
<p>Preparing our data to show the breakdown by category and country is challenging. We'll take a two-step approach here.
    First we count the prizes by category in each country:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">cat_country = df_data.groupby(['birth_country_current', 'category'], 
                               as_index=False).agg({'prize': pd.Series.count})
cat_country.sort_values(by='prize', ascending=False, inplace=True)</pre>
<figure><img height="367"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-39-34-67274118d7ced9c4bf5a8f81c3f667f1.png"
        width="416"></figure>
<p>Next, we can merge the DataFrame above with the top20_countries DataFrame that we created previously. That way we get
    the total number of prizes in a single column too. This is important since we want to control the order for our bar
    chart. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">merged_df = pd.merge(cat_country, top20_countries, on='birth_country_current')
# change column names
merged_df.columns = ['birth_country_current', 'category', 'cat_prize', 'total_prize'] 
merged_df.sort_values(by='total_prize', inplace=True)</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-42-03-e31d94a8366dcf1b7c91618eb9e234f9.png">
</figure>
<p>Now we can create our bar chart again. This time we use the color parameter based on the category. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">cat_cntry_bar = px.bar(x=merged_df.cat_prize,
                       y=merged_df.birth_country_current,
                       color=merged_df.category,
                       orientation='h',
                       title='Top 20 Countries by Number of Prizes and Category')

cat_cntry_bar.update_layout(xaxis_title='Number of Prizes', 
                            yaxis_title='Country')
cat_cntry_bar.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-44-31-1906cb97c5380befcc9d9c09d2880032.png">
</figure>
<p>Splitting the country bar chart by category allows us to get a very granular look at the data and answer a whole
    bunch of questions. For example, we see is that the US has won an incredible proportion of the prizes in the field
    of Economics. In comparison, Japan and Germany have won very few or no economics prize at all. Also, the US has more
    prizes in physics or medicine alone than all of France's prizes combined. On the chart, we also see that Germany won
    more prizes in physics than the UK and that France has won more prizes in peace and literature than Germany, even
    though Germany has been awarded a higher total number of prizes than France. </p>
<figure><img height="472"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_15-51-40-5627f6616c19c5a17810133b49a1fbc2.png"
        width="475"></figure>
<p>When did the United States become so dominant?&nbsp;Was it always this way? Has the prize become more global in
    scope?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;Country Prizes over Time</strong></p>
<p>To see how the prize was awarded over time. To do that, we can count the number of prizes by country by year. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">prize_by_year = df_data.groupby(by=['birth_country_current', 'year'], as_index=False).count()
prize_by_year = prize_by_year.sort_values('year')[['year', 'birth_country_current', 'prize']]</pre>
<p>Then we can create a series that has the cumulative sum for the number of prizes won. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">cumulative_prizes = prize_by_year.groupby(by=['birth_country_current',
                                              'year']).sum().groupby(level=[0]).cumsum()
cumulative_prizes.reset_index(inplace=True) </pre>
<p>Using this, we can create a chart, using the current birth country as the <code>color</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">l_chart = px.line(cumulative_prizes,
                  x='year', 
                  y='prize',
                  color='birth_country_current',
                  hover_name='birth_country_current')

l_chart.update_layout(xaxis_title='Year',
                      yaxis_title='Number of Prizes')

l_chart.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_16-05-40-d768858f0f5ab25eb4082e5b2d0332cf.gif">
</figure>
<p>What we see is that the United States really started to take off after the Second World War which decimated Europe.
    Prior to that, the Nobel prize was pretty much a European affair. Very few laureates were chosen from other parts of
    the world. This has changed dramatically in the last 40 years or so. There are many more countries represented today
    than in the early days. Interestingly we also see that the UK&nbsp;and Germany traded places in the 70s and 90s on
    the total number of prizes won. Sweden being 5th place pretty consistently over many decades is quite interesting
    too. Perhaps this reflects a little bit of home bias?&nbsp;😊 </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All this analysis of different countries makes me curious about where the actual research is happening. Where are the
    cities and organisations located where people actually make discoveries?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<h1>6</h1>

<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 1</h4>
<p>Many Nobel laureates are affiliated with a university, a laboratory, or a research organisation (apart from
    Literature and Peace prize winners as we've seen). But the world is a big place. Which research institutions had the
    most Nobel laureates working there at the time of making the discovery?</p>
<p>Create a bar chart showing the organisations affiliated with the Nobel laureates. It should looks something like
    this:</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1:&nbsp;The Top Research Organisations</strong></p>

<p>A higher population definitely means that there's a higher chance of a Nobel laureate to be born there. New York,
    Paris, and London are all very populous. However, Vienna and Budapest are not and still produced many prize winners.
    That said, much of the ground-breaking research does not take place in big population centres, so the list of birth
    cities is quite different from the list above. Cambridge Massachusets, Stanford, Berkely and Cambridge (UK)&nbsp;are
    all the places where many discoveries are made, but they are not the birthplaces of laureates. </p>

<p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;The Sunburst Chart</strong></p>
<p>Each country has a number of cities, which contain a number of cities, which in turn contain the research
    organisations. The sunburst chart is perfect for representing this relationship. It will give us an idea of how
    geographically concentrated scientific discoveries are!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">country_city_org = df_data.groupby(by=['organization_country', 
                                       'organization_city',

<p>France is a great example of concentration. Practically all the organisations affiliated with Nobel prize winners are
    in Paris. In contrast, scientific discoveries are much more spread out across Germany. Meanwhile, the UK&nbsp;is
    dominated by Cambridge and London.</p>

<p>How old are the Nobel laureates at the time when they win the prize?&nbsp;Does this vary by category?&nbsp;Also, how
    has the age of the laureates changed over time?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 1</h4>
<p>Calculate the age of the laureate in the year of the ceremony and add this as a column called
    <code>winning_age</code> to the <code>df_data</code> DataFrame. Hint: you can use <a
        href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.html"
        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> to help you.</p>

<h4>Challenge 2</h4>
<p>Who were the oldest and the youngest winners?</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>What are the names of the youngest and oldest Nobel laureate?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What did they win the prize for?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What is the average age of a winner?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>75% of laureates are younger than what age when they receive the prize?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Use Seaborn to <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                target="_blank">create histogram</a> to visualise the distribution of laureate age at the time of
            winning. Experiment with the number of <code>bins</code> to see how the visualisation changes.</p>
    </li>

<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 3</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Calculate the descriptive statistics for the age at the time of the award.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Then visualise the distribution in the form of a histogram using <a
                href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                target="_blank">Seaborn's .histplot() function</a>.</p>

        <p>Experiment with the <code>bin</code> size. Try 10, 20, 30, and 50.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenge 4</h4>
<p>Are Nobel laureates being nominated later in life than before? Have the ages of laureates at the time of the award
    increased or decreased over time?</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Use Seaborn to <a
                href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html?highlight=regplot#seaborn.regplot"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">create a .regplot</a> with a trendline.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Set the <code>lowess</code> parameter to <code>True</code> to show a moving average of the linear fit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>According to the best fit line, how old were Nobel laureates in the years 1900-1940 when they were awarded
            the prize?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>According to the best fit line, what age would it predict for a Nobel laureate in 2020?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 5</h4>
<p>How does the age of laureates vary by category?</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Use Seaborn's <a
                href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html?highlight=boxplot#seaborn.boxplot"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>.boxplot()</code></a> to show how the mean, quartiles,

        <p>In which prize category are the average winners the oldest?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In which prize category are the average winners the youngest?</p>

    <li>
        <p>You can also use plotly to create the box plot if you like.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge 6</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Now use Seaborn's <a
                href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html?highlight=lmplot#seaborn.lmplot"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>.lmplot()</code></a> and the <code>row</code> parameter
            to create 6 separate charts for each prize category. Again set <code>lowess</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

    <li>
        <p>What are the winning age trends in each category?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which category has the age trending up and which category has the age trending down?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Is this <code>.lmplot()</code> telling a different story from the <code>.boxplot()</code>?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a third chart with Seaborn. This time use <code>.lmplot()</code> to put all 6 categories on the same

<p><strong>Solution 1:&nbsp;Calculate the Age at the Time of Award</strong></p>
<p>First, we need to extract the year as a number from the birth_date column:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">birth_years = df_data.birth_date.dt.year</pre>
<p>Now we can work out the age at the time of the award:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_data['winning_age'] = df_data.year - birth_years</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:&nbsp;Oldest and Youngest Winners</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">display(df_data.nlargest(n=1, columns='winning_age'))
display(df_data.nsmallest(n=1, columns='winning_age'))</pre>

<p>John Goodenough was 97 years old when he got the Nobel prize!!! Holy moly. Interestingly John was born to American
    parents while they were in Germany. This is one example where our analysis of countries counts an extra "German"
    prize even though he is an American citizen. Too bad we don't have a nationality column in our dataset! Nonetheless,
    this goes to show it is never too late to win a Nobel prize. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3:&nbsp;Descriptive Statistics and Histogram</strong></p>
<p>Using <code>.describe()</code> is a fantastic way to get a feeling for how the numbers are distributed in a
    particular column. However, actually visualising them on a histogram to see their distribution is highly recommended
    too since it allows us to see if we have a bell-shaped curve or something else. </p>
<figure><img height="287"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_17-08-21-9a93fed328b9fcb987fe7f1fe891213a.png"
        width="417"></figure>
<p>Here's what the histogram looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4), dpi=200)
sns.histplot(data=df_data,
             x=df_data.winning_age,
             bins=30)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.title('Distribution of Age on Receipt of Prize')
plt.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_17-10-14-da5c8f344ae6c5029801d057b8fdc7da.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 4:&nbsp;Winning Age Over Time (All Categories)</strong></p>
<p>The histogram above shows us the distribution across the entire dataset, over the entire time period. But perhaps the
    age has changed over time. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(8,4), dpi=200)
with sns.axes_style("whitegrid"):
    sns.regplot(data=df_data,
                x='year',
                y='winning_age',
                lowess=True, 
                scatter_kws = {'alpha': 0.4},
                line_kws={'color': 'black'})

plt.show()</pre>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_17-12-43-5144baca380dabc48a83b7f56107e44f.png">
</figure>
<p>Using the lowess parameter allows us to plot a local linear regression. This means the best fit line is still linear,
    but it's more like a moving average which gives us a non-linear shape across the entire series. This is super neat
    because it clearly shows how the Nobel laureates are getting their award later and later in life. From 1900 to
    around 1950, the laureates were around 55 years old, but these days they are closer to 70 years old when they get
    their award!&nbsp;The other thing that we see in the chart is that in the last 10 years the spread has increased.
    We've had more very young and very old winners. In 1950s/60s winners were between 30 and 80 years old. Lately, that
    range has widened. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 5:&nbsp;Age Differences between Categories</strong></p>
<p>Seaborn allows us to create the above chart by category. But first, let's look at a box plot by category. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">plt.figure(figsize=(8,4), dpi=200)
with sns.axes_style("whitegrid"):
    sns.boxplot(data=df_data,
                x='category',
                y='winning_age')

plt.show()</pre>
<p>The box plot shows us the mean, the quartiles, the maximum and the minimum values. It raises an interesting
    question:&nbsp;"Are peace prize winners really older than physics laureates?".</p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_17-23-05-5e95226b748f8a0e7a4ce93dcfad6064.png">
</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution 6:&nbsp;Laureate Age over Time by Category</strong></p>
<p>To get a more complete picture, we should look at how the age of winners has changed over time. The box plot above
    looked at the dataset as a whole. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">with sns.axes_style('whitegrid'):
    sns.lmplot(data=df_data,
               x='year', 
               y='winning_age',
               row = 'category',
               lowess=True, 
               aspect=2,
               scatter_kws = {'alpha': 0.6},
               line_kws = {'color': 'black'},)

plt.show()</pre>
<p>We see that winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine have gotten older over time. The ageing trend is strongest
    for physics. The average age used to be below 50, but now it's over 70. Economics, the newest category, is much more
    stable in comparison. The peace prize shows the opposite trend where winners are getting younger! As such, our
    scatter plots showing the best fit lines over time and our box plot of the entire dataset can tell very different
    stories!</p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-20_17-31-22-d66b1a164a613c588b625f824fd37dfa.gif">
</figure>
<p>To combine all these charts into the same chart, we can use the <code>hue</code> parameter</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">with sns.axes_style("whitegrid"):
    sns.lmplot(data=df_data,
               x='year',
               y='winning_age',
               hue='category',
               lowess=True, 
               aspect=2,
               scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5},
               line_kws={'linewidth': 5})

<p>In this lesson, we reviewed many concepts that we've covered previously, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>How to uncover and investigate NaN values.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How to convert objects and string data types to numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Creating donut and bar charts with plotly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a rolling average to smooth out time-series data and show a trend.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How to use <code>.value_counts()</code>, <code>.groupby()</code>, <code>.merge()</code>,
            <code>.sort_values()</code> and <code>.agg()</code>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition, we learned many new things too. We looked at how to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create Sunburst charts with plotly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Use Seaborn's <code>.lmplot()</code> and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the
            <code>row</code>, <code>hue</code>, and <code>lowess</code> parameters.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots
            vs a time series analysis).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in
            Seaborn. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
