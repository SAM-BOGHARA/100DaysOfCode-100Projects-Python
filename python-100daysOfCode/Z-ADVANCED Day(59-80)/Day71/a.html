Let's get started!</p><p><br></p> -->

<p>Now that we've got our data loaded into our dataframe, we need to take a closer look at it to help us understand what
    it is we are working with. This is always the first step with any data science project. Let's see if we can answer
    the following questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>How many rows does our dataframe have?&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How many columns does it have?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>What are the labels for the columns?&nbsp;Do the columns have names?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Are there any missing values in our dataframe?&nbsp;Does our dataframe contain any bad data? </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We've already used the <code>.head()</code> method to peek at the top 5 rows of our dataframe. To see the number of
    rows and columns we can use the <code>shape</code> attribute: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df.shape</pre>
<p>Do you see 51 rows and 6 columns printed out below the cell?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw that each column had a name. We can access the column names directly with the <code>columns</code> attribute.
</p>

</figure>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Missing Values and Junk Data</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before we can proceed with our analysis we should try and figure out if there are any missing or junk data in our
    dataframe. That way we can avoid problems later on. In this case, we're going to look for NaN&nbsp;(Not A Number)
    values in our dataframe. NAN&nbsp;values are blank cells or cells that contain strings instead of numbers. Use the
    <code>.isna()</code>&nbsp;method and see if you can spot if there's a problem somewhere. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df.isna()</pre>
<p>Did you find anything? Check the last couple of rows in the dataframe:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">df.tail()</pre>
<p>Aha!&nbsp;We have a row that contains some information regarding the source of the data with blank values for all the
    other other columns. </p>
<figure><img
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_11-35-12-4320cf381d16ea74700b9f103ddd6842.png">
</figure>
<p><strong>Delete the Last Row</strong></p>
<p>We don't want this row in our dataframe. There's two ways you can go about removing this row. The first way is to
    manually remove the row at index 50. The second way is to simply use the <code>.dropna()</code> method from pandas.
    Let's create a new dataframe without the last row and examine the last 5 rows to make sure we removed the last row:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df = df.dropna()
clean_df.tail()</pre>
<p><br></p>


<p><strong>Find College Major with Highest Starting Salaries</strong> </p>
<p>To access a particular column from a data frame we can use the square bracket notation, like so:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary']</pre>
<p>You should see all the values printed out below the cell for just this column:</p>
<figure><img height="291"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_11-43-02-a2d17fe32f141cfc42f3b7c60d7b646c.png"
        width="372"></figure>
<p>To find the highest starting salary we can simply chain the <code>.max()</code> method. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].max()</pre>
<p>The highest starting salary is $74,300. But which college major earns this much on average?&nbsp;For this, we need to
    know the row number or <strong>index</strong> so that we can look up the name of the major. Lucky for us, the
    <code>.idxmax()</code> method will give us index for the row with the largest value. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].idxmax()</pre>
<p>which is 43. To see the name of the major that corresponds to that particular row, we can use the <code>.loc</code>
    (location) property. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[43]</pre>
<p>Here we are selecting both a column ('Undergraduate Major') and a row at index 43, so we are retrieving the value of
    a particular cell. You might see people using the double square brackets notation to achieve exactly the same
    thing:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Undergraduate Major'][43]</pre>
<p><br></p>
<figure><img height="197"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_11-56-10-07043fb3a8bb6a9f4fd3e5d17f4319d5.png"
        width="500"></figure>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you don't specify a particular column you can use the .loc property to retrieve an entire row: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df.loc[43]</pre>
<figure><img height="216"
        src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-09-22_11-58-08-1c59109dc860ad3b4571bc492a16445b.png"
        width="630"></figure>
<p><br></p>
<h4><strong>Challenge</strong></h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now that we've found the major with highest starting salary, can you write the code to find the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>What college major has the highest mid career salary? How much do graduates with this major earn? (Mid-career
            is defined as having 10+ years of experience). </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which college major has the lowest starting salary and how much do graduates earn after university?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Which college major has the lowest mid-career salary and how much can people expect to earn with this
            degree?&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll provide the solution and the code snippets in the next lesson =)&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you gave the last challenge a good go before checking the solution below.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The Highest Mid-Career Salary</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].max())
    print(f"Index for the max mid career salary: {clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].idxmax()}")
    clean_df['Undergraduate Major'][8]</pre>
<p>If you have multiple lines in the same cell, only the last one will get printed as an output automatically. If you'd
    like to see more than one thing printed out, then you still have to use a print statement on the lines above. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The Lowest Starting and Mid-Career Salary</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].min())
    clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].idxmin()]</pre>
<p>Here I've nested the code that we've seen in the previous lesson in the same line. We can also use the .loc property
    to access an entire row. Below I've accessed the row at the index of the smallest mid-career salary:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df.loc[clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].idxmin()]</pre>
<p>Sadly, education is actually the degree with both the lowest minimum starting and mid-career salary. </p>

<p><strong>Lowest Risk Majors</strong></p>
<p>A low-risk major is a degree where there is a small difference between the lowest and highest salaries. In other
    words, if the difference between the 10th percentile and the 90th percentile earnings of your major is small, then
    you can be more certain about your salary after you graduate. </p>
<p>How would we calculate the difference between the earnings of the 10th and 90th percentile?&nbsp;Well, Pandas allows
    us to do simple arithmetic with entire columns, so all we need to do is take the difference between the two columns:
</p>
<pre
    class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary'] - clean_df['Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary']</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use the <code>.subtract()</code> method. </p>
<pre
    class="prettyprint linenums">clean_df['Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary'].subtract(clean_df['Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary'])</pre>
<p>The output of this computation will be another Pandas dataframe column. We can add this to our existing dataframe
    with the <code>.insert()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">spread_col = clean_df['Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary'] - clean_df['Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary']
        clean_df.insert(1, 'Spread', spread_col)
        clean_df.head()</pre>
<p>The first argument is the position of where the column should be inserted. In our case, it's at position 1, so the
    second column. </p>

</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sorting by the Lowest Spread</strong></p>
<p>To see which degrees have the smallest spread, we can use the <code>.sort_values()</code> method. And since we are
    interested in only seeing the name of the degree and the major, we can pass a list of these two column names to look
    at the .head() of these two columns exclusively. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">low_risk = clean_df.sort_values('Spread')
        low_risk[['Undergraduate Major', 'Spread']].head()</pre>
<p>Does <code>.sort_values()</code> sort in ascending or descending order?&nbsp;To find out, check out the Pandas
    documentation:&nbsp;<a
        href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html</a>
</p>
<p>You can also bring up the quick documentation with shift + tab on your keyboard directly in the Python notebook. </p>

</figure>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p>Using the .sort_values() method, can you find the degrees with the highest potential? Find the top 5 degrees with the
    highest values in the 90th percentile.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, find the degrees with the greatest spread in salaries. Which majors have the largest difference between high
    and low earners after graduation. </p>
<p>I've got the solution for you in the next lesson. </p>

<p>Here's the solution to the challenge from the previous lesson: </p>
<p><strong>Majors with the Highest Potential</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">highest_potential = clean_df.sort_values('Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary', ascending=False)
            highest_potential[['Undergraduate Major', 'Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary']].head()</pre>
<p><strong>Majors with the Greatest Spread in Salaries</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">highest_spread = clean_df.sort_values('Spread', ascending=False)
            highest_spread[['Undergraduate Major', 'Spread']].head()</pre>
<p>Notice how 3 of the top 5 are present in both. This means that there are some very high earning Economics degree
    holders out there, but also some who are not earning as much. It's actually quite interesting to compare these two
    rankings versus the degrees where the median salary is very high. </p>
