<p>Given that the 1st user is the admin and the blog owner. It would make sense if we could link the blog posts they
    write to their user in the database. In the future, maybe we will want to invite other users to write posts in the
    blog and grant them the admin privileges. </p>
<p>So we need to create a <strong>relationship</strong> between the <code>User</code> table and the
    <code>BlogPost</code> table to link them together. So we can see which BlogPosts a User has written. Or see which
    User is the author of a particular BlogPost.</p>

<p>If we were just writing Python code, you could imagine creating a <code>User</code> object which has a property
    called <code>posts</code> that contains a&nbsp;List of <code>BlogPost</code> objects. </p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email, password):
         self.name = name
         self.email = email
         self.password = password
         self.posts = []

class BlogPost:
    def __init__(self, title, subtitle, body):
         self.title = title
         self.subtitle = subtitle
         self.body = body

new_user = User(
    name="Angela",
    email="angela@email.com",
    password=123456,
    posts=[
        BlogPost(
            title="Life of Cactus",
            subtitle="So Interesting",
            body="blah blah"
        )
    ]        
}</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>This would make it easy to find all the BlogPosts a particular user has written. But what about the other way around?
    How can you find the author of a particular BlogPost object? This is why we're using a database instead of just
    simple Python data structures. </p>
<p>In relational databases such as SQLite, MySQL or Postgresql we're able to define a relationship between tables using
    a <code>ForeignKey</code> and a <code>relationship()</code> method.</p>
<p>e.g. If we wanted to create a One to Many relationship between the User Table and the BlogPost table, where One User
    can create Many BlogPost objects, we can use the SQLAlchemy docs to achieve this. </p>

<p><strong>CHALLENGE 1</strong>: See if you can modify the User (Parent) and BlogPost (Child) class code to create a
    bidirectional One-to-Many relationship between the two tables. You should be able to easily locate the BlogPosts a
    User has written and also the User of any BlogPost object.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>If you refresh your Blog website, you'll see the author name disappear from the index.html and page.html pages. </p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE 2</strong>: Modify the index.html and post.html pages so that the author name is still displayed in
    the right places. </p>
<p>HINT: the author property of <code>BlogPost</code> is now a <code>User</code> object.</p>
